This datapack involves item hunts; getting as many items as possible within the vanilla Minecraft game.
All of the obtainable items have been put in the pack as advancements and categorised.

This doesn't mean, however, the game is playable already; as of now no logic has been put in for granting those advancements or getting points.

## Installation
Installation goes like any other datapack:
 - Download the latest ZIP from the releases page
 - Go into your [local Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft) saves folder
 - Pick the save you want to put the datapack into and navigate into it
 - Navigate into the `datapacks` folder and place your ZIP into here
 - If you have the world already opened while you do this, make sure to execute the `/reload` command

Now, you'll be ready to scavenge!
