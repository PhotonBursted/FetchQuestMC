This datapack involves item hunts; getting as many items as possible within the vanilla Minecraft game.
All of the obtainable items have been put in the pack as advancements and categorised.

## Installation
Installation goes like any other datapack:
 - Download the latest ZIP from the releases page
 - Go into your [local Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft) saves folder
 - Pick the save you want to put the datapack into and navigate into it
 - Navigate into the `datapacks` folder and place your ZIP into here
 - If you have the world already opened while you do this, make sure to execute the `/reload` command

Now, you'll be ready to scavenge!
